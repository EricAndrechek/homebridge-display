## Reporting a Vulnerability

In the event that you discover a serious vulnerability, please disclose it as soon as possible. If the vulnerability is something minor, just creating a Github issue is perfect. If, however, this bug is potentially dangerous and could affect more users of the plugin, feel free to send me an email or message me on Discord at Eric#1100
